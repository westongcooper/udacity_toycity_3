# ToyCity 3: Inventory Edition

## Project Overview

Great job generating the last few reports. Your boss was able to use the data you prepared for her to identify some problems with how the company was being run. And now, business is booming. In the short amount of time you've been learning Ruby, you've already added value at ToyCity. Keep it up.

She's got another project for you. After reviewing your reports, your boss has decided that the inventory system needs to be redone from the ground up.

Now, she knows that's a pretty big task, so all she's looking for right now is a proof of concept. Show her that you can use your new object-oriented skills to get a prototype up off the ground.

For this project, you'll be creating a way to keep track of product inventory, customer data, and transactions. These are the same types of problems you'll commonly be solving when working on a larger-scale web-app.

## Why Does This Matter?

Keeping large amounts of data organized is one of the number one challenges web developers address on a daily basis. The general organization of this project loosely reflects the structure of a tool called ActiveRecord, which is used frequently as a Ruby on Rails developer.

As you work through this project, think about real-world parallels in web apps you may already be familiar with. How might they organize their data? Which objects might they have?
